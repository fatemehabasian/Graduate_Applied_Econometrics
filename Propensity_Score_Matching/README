# Impact of Maternal Employment on Household Educational Expenditure

## Overview

This repository contains the code and report for an econometrics project that investigates the impact of maternal employment on household educational expenditures in Iran. The study utilizes data from the Household Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS) and employs a propensity score matching (PSM) technique to account for potential confounding variables. The analysis seeks to determine whether households with employed mothers allocate more resources towards their childrenâ€™s education compared to those where mothers are not employed.

## Project Structure

- **`Matching_Code.do`**: The Stata script used to implement the propensity score matching technique and other econometric analyses. This code processes the data, performs the matching, and calculates the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT).
- **`Report.pdf`**: The detailed report documenting the research findings, methodology, and analysis. The report covers the literature review, data description, empirical strategy, results, discussion, and conclusion.

## Project Description

### Research Question

The project explores the following key question:
- Does maternal employment significantly influence household educational expenditure in Iran?

### Methodology

- **Data Source**: The study uses data from the Household Expenditure and Income Survey (HEIS), which provides comprehensive information on household demographics, income, and expenditure patterns in Iran.
- **Empirical Strategy**: Propensity Score Matching (PSM) is employed to estimate the causal effect of maternal employment on household educational expenditures. This method controls for various socio-economic factors that could confound the relationship between maternal employment and educational spending.

### Key Findings

- The analysis finds that while maternal employment has a positive association with household income, its impact on educational expenditure is not statistically significant. This suggests that the additional income from maternal employment may not be primarily directed towards educational investments in the context of Iranian households.

## How to Use

1. **Running the Code**:
   - Open the `Matching_Code.do` file in Stata to replicate the analysis. The code performs data cleaning, matching, and estimation of the treatment effects.

2. **Viewing the Report**:
   - The `Report.pdf` provides a comprehensive explanation of the research, including the theoretical background, empirical methods, and detailed discussion of the results.
